# KTM-MODEL

## Description
 This model is typically created using the AutoCAD software, which allows designers to draft precise and detailed technical drawings of the motorcycle's various components, such as the frame, engine, wheels, and other key features. The 2D model provides an accurate blueprint that can be used for further analysis, modifications, or manufacturing purposes.
